# Codex ARPG Setup

This repository contains a simple Godot 4 project configured for a modular action RPG. It demonstrates basic WASD movement and a right-click melee attack with area feedback.

## Scenes
- `scenes/Player.tscn` – CharacterBody3D with a camera and `player.gd` script.
- `scenes/Main.tscn` – Main scene that instantiates the Player.

The `project.godot` file is configured to run `scenes/Main.tscn` by default and defines input actions for movement and attacking.

## Creating Additional Scenes
1. Open the project in Godot.
2. Add 3D nodes (enemies, environment, etc.) to `scenes/Main.tscn` or create new scenes that can be instanced into Main.
3. Extend `player.gd` or create additional scripts for abilities, items, and other gameplay elements to keep things modular.

## Controls
- **WASD** – Move the player.
- **Right Mouse Button** – Perform a melee attack. The attack area is displayed briefly as a red cylinder.

## Setup Instructions
1. Launch the Godot editor and open the project folder.
2. Press **Play** to run. The player can move and attack.
3. Use the provided scripts as a starting point for building a larger ARPG.
